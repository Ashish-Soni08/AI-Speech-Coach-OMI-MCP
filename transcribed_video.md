# https://www.youtube.com/watch/2FTx7DV7sv8

00:00:00.359 you once said the most dangerous person
00:00:03.240 is one who is articulate
00:00:07.020 what would you recommend to a one who
00:00:09.240 wants to learn to speak in a more
00:00:11.280 articulate manner
00:00:19.500 well articulate is an interesting word
00:00:21.480 eh because if your joints are
00:00:23.520 articulated
00:00:25.560 and that means you can do things with
00:00:27.300 them
00:00:28.140 because they're articulated right
00:00:29.580 they're not one solid vague Mass
00:00:33.239 they're differentiated
00:00:35.040 and someone who's graceful is
00:00:37.140 articulated
00:00:38.820 and compelling because they're
00:00:40.440 articulated and
00:00:44.340 speech is a form of articulation in that
00:00:47.160 manner because
00:00:48.899 the act of speech itself is extremely
00:00:50.940 complicated it's a very complicated
00:00:53.160 motor activity right it's very
00:00:54.840 complicated action to
00:00:57.000 dance with your tongue let's say
00:01:00.120 and
00:01:01.800 it is definitely the case that there is
00:01:04.019 no
00:01:04.979 more
00:01:06.500 exceptional form of
00:01:09.299 the capacity to be dangerous than to be
00:01:11.580 articulate and one of the things that
00:01:13.920 really shocks me and part of the reason
00:01:16.320 that my son and I
00:01:18.060 and our co-workers developed this essay
00:01:20.340 app is that
00:01:21.600 young men in particular are never taught
00:01:23.580 this
00:01:24.780 it's like well why learn to why be
00:01:27.360 literate
00:01:29.220 well do you do you want to be do you
00:01:32.100 want to be competent and dangerous or do
00:01:34.140 you want to be vague and useless
00:01:36.780 because those are your options and I
00:01:38.700 don't care what your job is
00:01:40.740 it doesn't matter what you end up doing
00:01:42.360 no if you're a plumber with great
00:01:45.960 respect for plumbers by the way and
00:01:48.119 you're articulate you can negotiate with
00:01:49.979 your clients you can introduce your
00:01:52.020 co-workers you can
00:01:53.759 you can make a case for your employees
00:01:56.399 you can you can advertise your services
00:01:59.939 you can think through your problems
00:02:02.759 your your
00:02:04.100 firing on all cylinders
00:02:07.580 in our whole cultures based on the idea
00:02:10.380 of the supremacy of the word our whole
00:02:13.020 culture is based on the idea that it is
00:02:14.700 the word itself that extracts habitable
00:02:17.400 order from chaos and possibility
00:02:20.340 and and the reason our culture is
00:02:22.500 predicated on that
00:02:25.020 is because it's a deep truth and to the
00:02:28.020 degree that our culture actually
00:02:29.280 embodies that it works
00:02:32.580 so
00:02:33.900 it's a great thing to be articulate
00:02:36.660 and it would be so lovely if our
00:02:41.160 Educators were wise enough to
00:02:43.680 communicate this appropriately
00:02:46.080 to young men
00:02:47.940 who are striving forward and to let them
00:02:50.819 know in no uncertain terms that if they
00:02:52.920 want to make themselves into forces to
00:02:55.980 be contended with
00:02:57.959 that there's no surer route to that then
00:03:02.640 an exceptional poetic literacy now it's
00:03:05.940 not like young people don't have
00:03:07.200 intuition of this there are reasons they
00:03:08.940 admire rap musicians for example who are
00:03:12.180 often extraordinarily articulate in
00:03:15.420 their performance and their
00:03:17.400 capacity for spontaneous poetic
00:03:20.040 utterance and certainly
00:03:23.040 the greatest people I've met including
00:03:25.739 great warriors
00:03:27.300 you might say
00:03:28.739 are great in no small part because
00:03:31.019 they're articulate I know
00:03:32.760 a former special
00:03:35.640 Services Special Operations Soldier Jaco
00:03:39.540 willink some of you might know about
00:03:41.640 charcoal he's got a pretty decent online
00:03:44.819 following and you know he's about four
00:03:47.459 feet wide and about three feet thick and
00:03:49.620 he's one tough son of a I'll tell
00:03:52.200 you you don't want to mess with him and
00:03:55.019 he knows perfectly well and is very
00:03:58.620 capable of articulating the fact that
00:04:01.980 his success as a eminent Warrior is in
00:04:06.840 no lar no small part dependent on his
00:04:09.120 ability to communicate
00:04:10.980 because he could communicate well he
00:04:13.799 could listen to the men
00:04:15.380 who were under his command because he
00:04:18.358 was articulate he could explain to his
00:04:20.760 superiors the situation on the ground
00:04:23.160 because he was articulate he could make
00:04:25.740 a case that the men under his command
00:04:28.560 who were deserving would be promoted
00:04:30.960 because he could think in an articulate
00:04:33.540 manner he could plan strategically and
00:04:36.000 not lose battles
00:04:39.780 okay so that's the case for being
00:04:41.699 articulate and what's the alternative
00:04:43.500 you want to be inarticulate you want to
00:04:45.840 say ah and like and um and pause and
00:04:49.740 stumble and and and be unable to
00:04:52.860 formulate a strategy be unable to
00:04:56.180 elucidate a vision be unable to compel
00:04:59.600 and convince other people to entice them
00:05:02.460 with with your with your articulated
00:05:06.600 vision of what might be you want the
00:05:09.180 opposite of that
00:05:10.500 that's why would you want that you would
00:05:14.220 you you would you would choose
00:05:16.440 awkwardness over Grace
00:05:18.540 that's
00:05:19.740 it's preposterous
00:05:22.199 it's
00:05:23.759 Beyond foolish and I cannot understand
00:05:26.400 for the life of me why this case isn't
00:05:29.340 made in a compelling manner particularly
00:05:31.320 to young men and I know it's not being
00:05:33.300 articulated to young men because they're
00:05:35.580 dropping out of the educational realm in
00:05:39.300 droves
00:05:40.740 and it's unbelievably sad so
00:05:44.820 how do you become articulate
00:05:47.160 well
00:05:50.220 by paying attention to what you say
00:05:53.940 that's a good start and what do I mean
00:05:56.580 by that
00:05:58.919 I mean pay attention
00:06:02.160 to what you say
00:06:04.740 so
00:06:08.340 you can you can you can think of this as
00:06:11.039 an analogy
00:06:12.840 so
00:06:15.120 imagine that you're trying to walk
00:06:16.560 across a swamp and the swamp is
00:06:19.259 murky but you know there's a path you
00:06:22.500 know there's a path of stone under the
00:06:26.039 water but it twists and moves and if you
00:06:29.220 stay on the path you won't drown the
00:06:31.080 crocodiles in the swamp won't devour you
00:06:33.120 and as you walk forward you can feel
00:06:36.180 with your
00:06:37.979 with your next step where the stone
00:06:40.020 might be
00:06:41.639 and then you feel it solid then you take
00:06:43.979 that step and then you do the same thing
00:06:45.960 with your foot again you search and and
00:06:48.660 you find out what saw it and you step on
00:06:50.880 it and you move forward in that manner
00:06:53.819 that's what you do with your words
00:06:56.520 it's the same thing
00:06:58.440 you feel and you you feel
00:07:01.740 is this
00:07:03.780 the right word how is it is the fact
00:07:08.280 that I'm uttering it putting me together
00:07:10.199 and making me
00:07:12.240 intact and stronger or is it
00:07:15.060 tearing me apart and making me dissolute
00:07:17.160 and weak
00:07:18.300 and and you can learn to do that
00:07:21.060 I learned this in part from Reading Carl
00:07:23.160 Rogers who's a great clinician and
00:07:25.080 Rogers believed that
00:07:30.120 the integration of language in action
00:07:32.400 was a necessary precondition for
00:07:34.680 operation as an effective clinician that
00:07:38.160 you had to
00:07:40.199 align what you said with who you were
00:07:43.620 and that one of the things that your
00:07:46.680 clients would be evaluating you for was
00:07:49.800 that
00:07:51.360 capability
00:07:52.860 and you might say that someone with that
00:07:55.199 capability
00:07:56.880 manifest themselves as genuine and
00:08:00.000 trustworthy
00:08:01.500 and
00:08:02.759 and more than that I would say also as
00:08:04.740 compelling and interesting although that
00:08:07.139 can be gamed but
00:08:09.240 the entire combination
00:08:12.240 that emerges out of
00:08:15.180 the domain of articulate
00:08:17.580 communication can't be gamed it's
00:08:21.479 not not easily
00:08:23.940 you feel your way
00:08:26.220 I noticed 40 years ago when I started
00:08:28.740 thinking these things through that
00:08:32.820 much of what I said actually made me
00:08:34.559 feel weak I didn't know why exactly but
00:08:37.020 sometimes some of the things I said
00:08:39.020 didn't have that effect they weren't
00:08:42.360 accompanied by a sense of Shame let's
00:08:44.399 say they weren't accompanied with a
00:08:47.339 sense of vulnerability
00:08:48.959 they were solid and at the beginning
00:08:51.180 that was probably only about five
00:08:52.740 percent of what I said the rest of it
00:08:55.019 was instrumental you know it was
00:08:56.399 language I was using to get my way in
00:08:58.920 the manner that Tammy described when she
00:09:01.440 introduced me tonight there was an
00:09:03.120 arrogance in my use of language that had
00:09:05.459 to do with the desire to attain proximal
00:09:07.680 victories right to appear smart let's
00:09:10.500 say to win an argument something like
00:09:12.240 that a very different idea than merely
00:09:14.700 feeling my way along to see what word
00:09:17.640 was appropriate for what moment
00:09:19.920 and but you can learn to do that
00:09:22.140 and you can listen to yourself and you
00:09:24.240 can stop humming and hawing and using
00:09:27.120 like and you know and fillers and you
00:09:30.660 can take the time necessary to craft
00:09:33.720 your words carefully and you can
00:09:37.500 practice
00:09:38.660 merely saying what you believe to be
00:09:41.459 true
00:09:43.440 and you can read
00:09:45.540 and you can read great writers and you
00:09:47.580 can write and you can write about what
00:09:50.339 you think about the problems that obsess
00:09:52.980 you
00:09:54.839 and you can become articulate as a
00:09:57.180 consequence and there'll be nothing
00:09:58.500 about that that isn't the adventure of
00:10:00.540 your life
00:10:02.459 and so it's a moral Endeavor in some
00:10:04.680 real sense right to become articulate is
00:10:07.140 to become the master of your own tongue
00:10:10.019 and
00:10:12.839 to become properly articulate is to
00:10:20.160 is to make the word divine
00:10:23.339 and to treat it in that manner
00:10:25.740 and to decide whether or not you believe
00:10:27.240 that it is the case that the Divine word
00:10:30.839 creates the order that's habitable and
00:10:33.000 good and if you do believe that
00:10:36.480 well if you don't believe that then what
00:10:38.459 do you believe
00:10:39.600 and if you do believe that well
00:10:42.899 go all in
00:10:45.000 see what happens
00:10:46.680 see what happens if you become
00:10:48.000 articulate
00:10:54.340 [Applause]
00:11:05.220 I'll I'll give you one more small
00:11:07.560 example Tammy touched on this in the
00:11:09.660 introduction too she said she'd learned
00:11:11.760 to pause
00:11:14.519 you can pause it's it's a prayerful
00:11:17.459 pause in some sense
00:11:22.019 when you're in a discussion with someone
00:11:23.700 you can ask yourself
00:11:25.560 they might present you with a question
00:11:27.240 or a conundrum or a proposition and
00:11:29.820 instead of responding with what you know
00:11:32.399 to be right so to speak you could just
00:11:35.100 ask yourself what do I actually think
00:11:37.079 about that
00:11:38.279 but it has to be a real question it has
00:11:40.680 to be the kind of question that you'd
00:11:42.060 posed to someone you didn't know
00:11:44.220 it has to be a question predicated on
00:11:46.620 the idea that you might not know who you
00:11:48.240 are
00:11:48.959 and that you could ask and so someone
00:11:51.600 will present you with a question you
00:11:53.220 think okay
00:11:56.700 what do I think about that
00:11:59.040 but you have to want to know the answer
00:12:00.540 and then the answer will make itself
00:12:02.220 known
00:12:03.540 because that's how thought works and
00:12:05.279 then you can just communicate that
00:12:06.720 answer
00:12:08.459 and and if you do that you'll be
00:12:10.500 interesting right away
00:12:12.540 you'll be interesting to the person that
00:12:14.160 you're talking to and if they do that to
00:12:16.680 you they'll be interesting too and then
00:12:18.360 if you both do that you'll have an
00:12:19.680 interesting conversation and if you have
00:12:22.019 an interesting conversation you'll both
00:12:23.519 grow as a consequence and that's
00:12:25.500 actually the pathway to growth
00:12:28.380 and you just wait you can wait you can
00:12:31.260 open yourself up to the possibility that
00:12:33.779 what needs to be said will make itself
00:12:36.180 manifest if that's what you
00:12:41.100 are striving for
00:12:42.899 if that's what you're asking for and
00:12:45.000 then you can merely communicate that you
00:12:47.579 have to abandon instrumentality to do
00:12:49.740 that so one of the reasons Joe Rogan is
00:12:52.440 so successful by the way
00:12:55.019 is that that's what Joe does
00:12:57.839 he just asked questions
00:12:59.700 he doesn't he isn't trying to get
00:13:01.680 something from his guests he's not
00:13:03.899 trying to become more famous he doesn't
00:13:06.300 need any more money there's no
00:13:08.279 instrumental utilization of language in
00:13:10.560 his discourse he's just
00:13:13.680 a humble lunk head you know in the most
00:13:16.440 profound sense
00:13:17.880 who would like to know more than he
00:13:19.860 knows
00:13:20.880 and who asks all the stupid questions he
00:13:23.519 can think up
00:13:25.139 and it turns out that he's actually very
00:13:27.180 very smart and
00:13:29.160 and very well educated now from after
00:13:32.220 talking to hundreds and hundreds of
00:13:33.720 people and listening and so the stupid
00:13:35.760 questions he asks aren't stupid and
00:13:38.100 they're questions that are shared by
00:13:39.660 virtually everyone who's listening and
00:13:42.060 he takes his listeners Along on this
00:13:44.399 process of exploratory Endeavor and it's
00:13:47.519 the pathway to success
00:13:49.920 and the same thing can be true of your
00:13:52.380 life
00:13:53.519 the pathway to success is
00:13:56.459 is much
00:13:58.260 it's a
00:14:02.940 if you're Guided by the spirit of honest
00:14:05.279 inquiry and every word you say is
00:14:08.220 reflective of what you believe to be the
00:14:10.260 truth then the pathway that you walk on
00:14:13.139 is a golden Pathway to success
00:14:16.800 and and I I know that I know that to be
00:14:19.920 true
